# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on catching up with all the technology in my profession (web development, administration, etc). My skillset has always been limited to and dictated by the jobs I've had at any given time. With the exception of my unsuccessful freelance days, I've tended to fall behind the rest of the world in this field.

I am currently learning these things that everyone else already knows:

 - Git
 - Twig
 - Drupal
 - Docker / DDEV
 - VS Code


About Me

Late life ADHD diagnosed; a lot of the stuff in my past makes more sense now that I have this diagnosis. Thank you to my ADHD friend at work for recognizing it and helping me figure a lot of stuff out.

Trying to golf and exercise more.

Pronouns: He/him

Father of two beautiful young men.

Commit title here? Adding basic bio information I hope nobody reads.
The GitHub for Dummies book says to scroll to the bottom of the page to add a title to the commit, but I don't see where that would be.
