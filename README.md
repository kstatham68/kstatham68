## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on catching up with all the technology in my profession (web development, administration, etc). My skillset has always been limited to and dictated by the jobs I've had at any given time. With the exception of my unsuccessful freelance days, I've tended to fall behind the rest of the world in this field.

I am currently learning these things that everyone else already knows:

 - Git
 - Twig
 - Drupal
 - Docker / DDEV
 - VS Code


About Me

Trying to golf and exercise more.

Pronouns: He/him
